# External Source Schema Draft

This document outlines a future database model for importing external nutrition datasets such as NEVO, ANSES/Ciqual, BLS, Open Food Facts, and other official or public sources.

The current application still uses the existing local USDA/Appendix H-style dataset for the calculator. External sources should be modeled separately first, then validated before they are connected to user-facing calculator features.

## Design Goals

The external-source model should support:

- multiple nutrition data providers
- source-specific food identifiers
- source-specific categories and food names
- many nutrients per food
- missing nutrient values stored as missing values, not zero
- source and reference metadata for nutrient values
- future mapping between similar foods from different sources

The model should avoid forcing all datasets into the current `foods` table too early. Different sources have different structures, units, naming conventions, and reference systems.

## Proposed Tables

## Visual Example

The model can be understood as a set of linked tables.

```text
data_sources
    |
    |-- source_foods
    |
    |-- source_nutrients
    |
    |-- source_references

source_foods ---- source_food_nutrient_values ---- source_nutrients
                         |
                         |
                  source_references
```

Example source:

```text
data_sources

id | code | name      | country
1  | NEVO | NEVO 2025 | Netherlands
```

Example foods:

```text
source_foods

id | data_source_id | source_food_code | food_name_en      | category_en          | basis
1  | 1              | 1                | Potatoes raw      | Potatoes and tubers  | per_100g
2  | 1              | 2                | Potatoes new raw  | Potatoes and tubers  | per_100g
3  | 1              | 270              | Milk raw          | Milk and products    | per_100ml
```

Example nutrients:

```text
source_nutrients

id | data_source_id | source_nutrient_code | source_nutrient_name | unit
1  | 1              | ENERCC               | Energy kcal          | kcal
2  | 1              | PROT                 | Protein total        | g
3  | 1              | FAT                  | Fat total            | g
4  | 1              | FIBT                 | Fibre dietary total  | g
```

Example references:

```text
source_references

id | data_source_id | source_code | reference_text
1  | 1              | REF.0472    | logical reasoning...
2  | 1              | REF.0814    | NEVO-team internal document...
```

Example nutrient values:

```text
source_food_nutrient_values

id | source_food_id | source_nutrient_id | value | unit | basis    | reference_id
1  | 1              | 1                  | 80    | kcal | per_100g | 2
2  | 1              | 2                  | 2     | g    | per_100g | 1
3  | 1              | 3                  | 0.1   | g    | per_100g | 1
4  | 1              | 4                  | 1.8   | g    | per_100g | 1
```

This means:

```text
Potatoes raw has 80 kcal per 100g according to reference 2.
Potatoes raw has 2 g protein per 100g according to reference 1.
Potatoes raw has 0.1 g fat per 100g according to reference 1.
Potatoes raw has 1.8 g fibre per 100g according to reference 1.
```

This structure keeps foods, nutrients, values, references, and data sources separate. That makes the database easier to validate and easier to extend with more datasets later.

### data_sources

Stores one row per external dataset.

Examples:

```text
NEVO
ANSES_CIQUAL
BLS
OPEN_FOOD_FACTS
USDA_APPENDIX_H
```

Suggested fields:

```text
id
code
name
country
publisher
source_url
license_name
license_url
attribution_text
version
created_at
updated_at
```

Purpose:

This table identifies where each imported food record comes from.

### source_foods

Stores foods exactly as they appear in each source dataset.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
data_source_id
source_food_code
food_name_original
food_name_en
food_name_ro
category_original
category_en
category_ro
basis
notes
created_at
updated_at
```

NEVO examples:

```text
source_food_code -> NEVO-code
food_name_original -> Voedingsmiddelnaam/Dutch food name
food_name_en -> Engelse naam/Food name
category_en -> Food group
basis -> Hoeveelheid/Quantity, for example per 100g or per 100ml
```

Purpose:

This table keeps source foods separate from the current user-facing `foods` table. It preserves the original source identity and prevents premature deduplication.

### nutrients

Stores nutrient definitions.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
canonical_code
name_en
name_ro
default_unit
nutrient_group
created_at
updated_at
```

Examples:

```text
ENERGY_KCAL
PROTEIN
CARBOHYDRATE
FAT
FIBRE
WATER
SODIUM
IRON
```

Purpose:

This table gives the project a future standard vocabulary for nutrients. Source-specific nutrient codes can be mapped to these canonical nutrients.

### source_nutrients

Stores nutrient definitions as provided by each source.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
data_source_id
source_nutrient_code
source_nutrient_name
unit
component_group
canonical_nutrient_id
created_at
updated_at
```

NEVO examples:

```text
source_nutrient_code -> Nutrient-code
source_nutrient_name -> Component
unit -> Eenheid/Unit
component_group -> Component group
```

Purpose:

This table separates source-specific nutrient definitions from the future canonical nutrient model.

For example, NEVO has `ENERCC`, while another source may use another code for kcal. Both can eventually map to the same canonical nutrient.

### source_references

Stores source and reference metadata for nutrient values.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
data_source_id
source_code
reference_text
created_at
updated_at
```

NEVO examples:

```text
source_code -> Broncode/Source code
reference_text -> Referentie/Reference
```

Purpose:

This table avoids repeating long reference text on every nutrient-value row. It also preserves data lineage.

### source_food_nutrient_values

Stores nutrient values for source foods.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
source_food_id
source_nutrient_id
value
unit
basis
reference_id
created_at
updated_at
```

NEVO examples:

```text
source_food_id -> source_foods.id for a NEVO-code
source_nutrient_id -> source_nutrients.id for a Nutrient-code
value -> Gehalte/Value
unit -> Eenheid/Unit
basis -> per 100g or per 100ml
reference_id -> source_references.id
```

Purpose:

This is the main fact table for nutrition values.

One row means:

```text
one source food + one source nutrient + one value
```

## Handling Missing Values

Missing nutrient values should be stored as `NULL`.

They should not be converted to zero unless the source explicitly reports zero.

Reason:

```text
missing value = unknown or unavailable
zero = known measured/reported zero
```

These are different meanings and should not be mixed.

## Handling `per 100g` and `per 100ml`

NEVO has two observed bases:

```text
per 100g
per 100ml
```

The import model should preserve this basis.

Suggested normalized values:

```text
per_100g
per_100ml
```

Calculator logic should not assume that every source food is per 100 g.

## Handling Duplicate Food/Nutrient Pairs

NEVO Details contains repeated `NEVO-code + Nutrient-code` pairs because some nutrients appear in more than one component group.

Profiling showed:

```text
Food/nutrient pairs with different value or unit: 0
```

This means repeated pairs do not create conflicting nutrient values.

Possible import rule:

```text
Deduplicate NEVO values by source_food_code, source_nutrient_code, value, unit, and reference.
```

The importer should still log repeated pairs so the behavior is visible during validation.

## Future Food Deduplication

Foods from different sources should not be merged too early.

For example:

```text
banana in NEVO
banana in ANSES
banana in BLS
banana in Open Food Facts
```

These records may look similar but can have different:

- source codes
- languages
- categories
- nutrient methods
- units
- branded/generic status
- references

A future matching layer can be added later.

Possible future table:

```text
canonical_foods
```

Possible future link table:

```text
canonical_food_source_links
```

Purpose:

This would allow the application to group equivalent foods while preserving each source record.

## Recommended Import Order

For NEVO, the future import should happen in this order:

1. Insert `data_sources` row for NEVO.
2. Import `source_foods` from `NEVO2025_v9.0.csv`.
3. Import `source_nutrients` from `NEVO2025_v9.0_Nutrienten_Nutrients.csv`.
4. Import `source_references` from source/reference fields in `NEVO2025_v9.0_Details.csv`.
5. Import `source_food_nutrient_values` from `NEVO2025_v9.0_Details.csv`.
6. Run validation checks after import.

## Recommended Validation Checks

After importing NEVO, validate:

- number of imported foods equals 2328
- number of unique source nutrient codes equals 137
- no missing `source_food_id` links
- no missing `source_nutrient_id` links
- no missing source/reference metadata
- kcal/protein/carbs/fat/fibre values match the profiled main file
- missing values remain `NULL`
- `per 100g` and `per 100ml` are preserved

## Current Decision

The current calculator should continue using the existing local dataset.

External sources should be imported into separate tables first. After profiling, validation, and review, the project can decide how to expose those sources in the UI.
